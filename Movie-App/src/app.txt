respected [HOD/Cordinator/Director],

I am writing to request your permission to accept a full-time internship opportunity at Algobulls. As a student of BCA 2021-2024 at Delhi Technical Campus, I will continue to maintain my academic commitments and complete my coursework to the best of my abilities, while also fulfilling my responsibilities as an intern at Algobulls. I am confident that I can balance these commitments effectively and will make every effort to minimize any disruption to my studies.

I wanted to share this news with you as soon as possible, as I believe it reflects positively on the education and support I have received at Delhi Technical Campus. I understand that my academic responsibilities take precedence, and I will communicate regularly with my professors and academic advisors to ensure that I am meeting all requirements.

Thank you for your consideration of my request. 

Sincerely,
Satyam verma
